Hi, I'm Chuhui (Leo) Liu, a Computer Science student at the University at Buffalo, motivated to use my education for meaningful global impact. I’ve embarked on a research journey under Prof. [Wenyao Xu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu/)'s mentorship. This experience aligns with my deep interest in using technology to tackle complex, real-world problems. I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and practical applications, aiming to deliver innovative solutions to contemporary challenges. Through this website, I am excited to share my journey with you!

My research interests include Mobile Health (mHealth), neural machine translation, and computer vision. I have published 3 research/poster papers (including 1 first-author paper) in the IEEE Conference on Body Sensor Networks (BSN), and my work focuses on developing cost-effective, accessible health monitoring systems.
